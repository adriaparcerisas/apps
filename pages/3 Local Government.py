st.markdown('One of the main aspects to be aware about the blockchains that use proof of stake is the decentralization. **Decentralization** is by far one of the most important factors in a crypto ecosystem. As you probably already figured out, the validation system in place might fail to honor this by progressively moving towards a more traditional centralized environment. Why and how could this happen?')
